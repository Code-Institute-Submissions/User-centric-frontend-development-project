# [Waterford Greenway Wesbite](https://paraiccooney.github.io/User-centric-frontend-development-project/)


The Greenway is a cycle path & tourist attraction. The goal of this website is to create a webpage that displays details of this attraction in an appealing & concise manner while providing a positive user experience. The end goal is to entice users to visit.

## UX User stories;

 As an active tourist, I want to find out as much as I can about the Greenway so that I can make an informed decision about where to visit. I want to know my options for renting a bike & where to rent, where to stop along the way, & plan my route using a map as I may complete part of the full route. I want this information to be displayed clearly & to find what I'm looking for without sifting through much other information.

## WIREFRAMES;

 Project wireframes are available in the Wireframes folder. After completing the wireframes I made a number of changes; 

 1.  I realised that a facilities page is something which would best
    be served by a later release & when the information was more readily
    available.

 

 1.  I decided against using the container class to display
    information & decided given the amount of information it was best of
    utilise the full screen width & use the container-fluid class.

 

 1. I decided against masking the Greenway writing on the homepage
    using an image of grass. This is due to the requirement of contrast
    against the prodominantly green background image.
 2. I decided that the animation would best be served on top of the
    footer as opposed to the background image on the homepage.

 

 1. I decided against including an animation of a bird in my footer
    animation.

 

 1. I decided to place the places of interest timeline vertically as
    opposed to horizontally. This is due to the fact that there are too
    many places to reference without compressing the information into an
    unreadable format were it to be displayed horizontally on screen.

## CURRENT FEATURES;

 To achieve the below features I imported a number of libraries, namely Bootstrap, Font Awesome, & Hover.css 
 **Navbar** - allows the user to navigate to any section of the site from any page & is visible in the fold upon landing to reduce page-bounces. 
 **Footer animation** - this will provide the user with a pleasant & playful user experience. 
 **Embedded maps** - there a a number of maps integrated onto the site to allow the user to immediately view where each bike rental resource is & view the entire route in detail. 
 **Responsive design** - The site was designed using a mobile first approach. Both the navbar & informational/functional divs expand on larger screens to utilise the full screen of the user & display information more concisely with a greater proportion of elements being displayed above the fold. 
 **Border timeline** - A border timeline has been included & is visible on larger screen sizes on the Places Of Interest page to visually demonstrate to the user that the locations being described are in the order that they will be experienced by the user in real life should they be travelling one direction.

## Future Implementation Features

 **Contact** - when fully connected this allows the user to contact the administator for more information. This will help the administator to review & determine if additional information/features are to be included in future. **Gallery** - In future I would like to implement a gallery section where users could upload images which the site administator could then "pin" to the top of the page. 
 **Facilities Page** - In future a features page could be implemented to provide additional information. To date this information is not available. The features page was included in the original wireframes however all the information is not available as of yet (toilets, parking, child/elderly/disable friendly, & water stations) so this is currently ommited.

## TESTING

I have run a number of tests on the website to ensure all links are working & all information is being displayed clearly on all screensizes with breakpoints being used effectively for use by the user outlined in the User Stories section above. The Contact button does however still require connection for the user to effectively submit their query. During testing I became more familiar with the Bootstrap library & noticied their use of !important which initally had resulted in my breakpoints experience issues.
